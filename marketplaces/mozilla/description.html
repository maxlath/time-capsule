The best person to send you links matching your interests is a time traveling version of yourself: <strong>create a time capsule by choosing when the current tab should be re-opened</strong>; this will bookmark the current tab, and program to re-open it in the future, according to the choosen periodicity, be it an hour, a day, a month, a year, a decade!

It will then re-open at this periodicity until the end of times. Or until you un-bookmark it.

<h3>Why would I need this?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have a bookmark folder with 10,000 things-you-should-absolutely-keep-in-mind but never actually re-open once bookmarked? Now, if you don't come back to those things, those things come back to you!</li>
  <li><strong>Works very well when learning a new subject</strong>: you open many links which for most don't make sense now, but would probably make sense in a few months. (that worked awesome for me when learning web development).</li>
  <li>
    Works very well as a <strong>memo/alarm mechanism</strong>: "Now isn't the time to deal with [enter the task on which you plan to procrastinate], but I got to see this page in X hours/days/etc."
  </li>
  <li>In some ways, the logo may look like a bow tie. Bow ties are cool.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Top features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Super customizable periodicity</strong>: if the offered buttons aren't enough, click on the popup (to get focus on it) and start typing the precise number of a time unit you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated with the browser bookmarks</strong>, which gives numerous advantages:
    <ul>
      <li>Pages you bookmark this way will show up when you're searching a page (if you activated bookmark suggestion)</li>
      <li>All your time capsules are grouped in a folder in your bookmarks, which makes them easy to browse/search</li>
      <li>Easy to export/import: simply import export your bookmarks and your time capsules will come along!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It's <a href="http://github.com/maxlath/time-capsule" title="read Time Capsule code on Github">libre/open source</a></li>
  <li>Built with the latest WebExtension standard: shouldn't break until next decade addon revolution</li>
  <li>Comes with (poor) time-traveling jokes</li>
</ul>

If you feel the need but this doesn't match your expectations, you might be happy with the perfectly fine <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/snooze-tabs">Snooze Tab addon</a>.

Sending links to your past self isn't possible yet, but could come in a future version. It might be a premium feature reserved to <a href="https://liberapay.com/maxlath" title="Make recurrent donations on Liberapay">generous donators</a>.

<h3>Advices to keep it sane</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do not keep too many bookmarks with a short periodicity: that's gonna be very spammy.</li>
  <li>Rule of thumb: if a tab re-opens 3 times, and you closed it immediatly the 3 times without considering acting upon it, deal with it now or un-bookmark it.</li>
  <li>Avoid time paradoxes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
It basically rely on an internal time vortex to send the links. See the <a href="https://github.com/maxlath/time-capsule">code</a> for more details.
