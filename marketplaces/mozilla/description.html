The best person to send you links matching your interests is a time traveling version of yourself: <strong>create a time capsule by choosing when the current tab should be re-opened</strong>; this will bookmark the current tab, and program to re-open it in the future, according to the choosen periodicity, be it an hour, a day, a month, a year, a decade!

It will then re-open at this periodicity until the end of times. Or until you un-bookmark it.

<strong>Why would I need this?</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have a bookmark folder with 10,000 things-you-should-absolutely-keep-in-mind but never actually re-open once bookmarked? Now, if you don't come back to those things, those things come back to you!</li>
  <li>Works very well when learning a new subject: you open many links which for most don't make sense now, but would probably make sense in a few months. (that worked awesome for me when learning web development).</li>
  <li>
    Works very well as a <strong>memo/alarm mechanism</strong>: "Now isn't the time to deal with [enter the task on which you plan to procrastinate], but I got to see this page in X hours/days/etc."
  </li>
  <li>In some ways, the logo may look like a bow tie. Bow ties are cool.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Top features</strong>

  <ul>

Sending links to your past self isn't possible yet, but could come in a future version. It might a premium feature, but you can pre-register by making a <a href="https://liberapay.com/maxlath" title="Make recurrent donations on Liberapay">donation</a>.

<strong>Advices to keep it sane</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Do not keep too many bookmarks with a short periodicity: that's gonna be very spammy.</li>
  <li>Rule of thumb: if a tab re-opens 3 times, and you closed it immediatly the 3 times without considering acting upon it, deal with it now or un-bookmark it.</li>
  <li>Avoid time paradoxes at all costs.</li>
</ul>
